# Fish Market - Model & Loss Function Analysis

Comparative analysis of neural network architectures and loss functions for regression tasks.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes how different loss functions and model architectures affect performance when predicting fish weights from physical measurements.

## Running the Code

**Jupyter Notebook**:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Fish_Market_Model_Loss_Function_Analysis.ipynb
```

**Python**:
```bash
python src/Fish_Market_Model_Loss_Function_Analysis.py
```

## Components

- Comparison of multiple loss functions (MSE, MAE, Huber, etc.)
- Different neural network architectures tested
- Performance metrics and analysis
- Visualization of results

## Dataset

Fish Market dataset containing measurements of various fish species used to predict weight.
